        <h2>My Experience</h2>

        <div class="experience-item">
            <h3>Pioneering American Football in West Africa</h3>
            <p>My journey in sports began with a strong foundation in basketball, where I honed my coaching skills and developed a passion for athlete development. However, a significant chapter of my career has been dedicated to pioneering American football in Nigeria and West Africa. As one of the early proponents of the sport, I had the privilege of playing in the first-ever American football game in the region, a landmark event that opened doors for the sport's growth. This experience ignited a drive to expand the sport's reach.</p>
            <p>I organized and participated in a coaching tour that spanned from Nigeria to Ghana and then to CÃ´te d'Ivoire. This tour was instrumental in introducing the sport to new communities and laying the groundwork for its future development. I have also coached and played in flag football teams, further contributing to the sport's growth in Nigeria.</p>
